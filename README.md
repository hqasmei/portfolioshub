## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment

   - Once logged in, create a new project.
   - Upon creating your project, you will receive environment variables required for the application's configuration.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
   - Add the following environment variables you obtained from Convex:
     ```
     CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=<your_convex_deployment>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your_convex_url>
     ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
This command will start the local development server on http://localhost:3000. If your Convex project is not set up yet, you will be prompted in the terminal to go through the setup process.
