Our services may contain links to other websites, applications, and

on another third party link, you will be directed to that third
party&apos;s website, application, or online service. The fact that we

representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an

practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or
services.

## Third Party Privacy Policies

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites. Thus, we are
advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these
third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include
their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain
options.

You can choose to disable cookies through your individual browser
options. To know more detailed information about cookie management with
specific web browsers, it can be found at the browsers&apos; respective
websites.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device by your browser.
They serve various purposes, such as remembering your preferences,
enhancing user experience, and facilitating authentication.

At our site, we utilize third-party authentication services, including
Google OAuth, to secure and streamline the login process. When you log
in using Google OAuth, a cookie is generated and stored on your device.
This cookie is essential for the proper functioning of our
authentication system.

The Google OAuth cookie contains a unique identifier that helps us
recognize your authenticated session. It enables you to access our
application seamlessly without the need to re-enter your credentials
repeatedly during a single session.

It&apos;s important to note that these cookies do not store personal
information directly on our servers. Instead, they serve as tokens that
establish a secure connection between your browser and the
authentication provider, in this case, Google. This enhances the
security of the authentication process while providing a more
user-friendly experience.

By using our site and opting for third-party authentication, you consent
to the use of cookies for authentication purposes. You can manage your
cookie preferences through your browser settings.
